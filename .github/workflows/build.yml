# Reusable workflow for building the solution.
#
# This workflow is designed to be called by other workflows to avoid
# redundant compilation. It builds the solution and uploads the build
# artifacts for downstream jobs to consume.
#
# Usage in other workflows:
#   jobs:
#     build:
#       uses: ./.github/workflows/build.yml
#       with:
#         configuration: Release
#
#     dependent-job:
#       needs: build
#       steps:
#         - uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
#           with:
#             name: build-output-Release
